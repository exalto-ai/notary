# Third-party notices

Exalto’s hosted product code is proprietary. This notice does not grant a
license to it. The runtime and desktop application are MIT licensed under
`runtime/LICENSE-MIT` and `apps/notary-app/LICENSE-MIT`. Third-party components
retain their own licenses; see `runtime/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.

The CLI and services link third-party Rust crates. Their exact, reproducible
set is recorded in the committed `Cargo.lock`; each crate's declared SPDX
license is available from its `Cargo.toml` in the crates.io source archive.
The web application dependencies are equivalently pinned in
`platform/web/package-lock.json`.

This repository also vendors a locally patched copy of TLSNotary in
`runtime/vendor/tlsn`. The patch is maintained only for the protocol behavior described
in this repository. The vendored crates declare the following licenses in their
`Cargo.toml` files:

| Component | License expression |
| --- | --- |
| `tlsn`, `tls-server-fixture`, `mpc-tls`, `core`, `sdk-core`, `wasm` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |
| `tls-core` | Apache-2.0 OR ISC OR MIT |

The workspace additionally vendors a locally patched copy of the TLSNotary
`spansy` parser crate (from `tlsnotary/tlsn-utils`) in `runtime/vendor/tlsn-utils`,
declared as MIT OR Apache-2.0. Its patch bounds JSON parser stack usage and is
described in `runtime/vendor/tlsn-utils/README.md`.

No third-party trademark rights are granted by this notice.

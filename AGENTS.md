# Notary agent guide

This file is the source of truth for agent instructions. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it.

## Project map

- `runtime/` is the self-contained public workspace. It owns core protocol/evidence contracts, the local daemon, thin REST CLI, generic remote notary, updater, local dashboard, runtime docs, and pinned TLSNotary sources.
- `platform/crates/notary-api/` owns the hosted account, credit, billing, upload, and sharing API. `platform/crates/notary-server-platform-adapter/` is the private admission and settlement adapter around the generic notary.
- `runtime/vendor/tlsn/` is a pinned, locally patched TLSNotary dependency. Treat it as third-party code; change it only when the protocol requires it and explain the patch.
- `apps/notary-app/` is the desktop application that bundles and supervises `notaryd`.
- `platform/web/` is the hosted Vite/React website. `runtime/apps/admin-dashboard/` is the daemon dashboard. Follow [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) for UI work.
- `docs/README.md` indexes user, operator, and contributor documentation. `compose.yml`, `deploy/`, and `.github/workflows/` define the container configuration and Fly.io deployment.

## Non-negotiable trust boundaries

- The local proxy handles plaintext and credentials; the remote notary must not receive either. Never log or publish API-key values. A deferred `.llmcapture` necessarily retains an encrypted client checkpoint that can reconstruct the original request, including credentials, so treat it as the most sensitive local artifact and never write it without vault encryption.
- Keep the provider hostname allowlist explicit. The notary, not the local machine, resolves and opens the upstream provider connection.
- A capture is private evidence. Its artifacts, hashes, selective-disclosure behavior, save/load logic, and verifier must evolve together.
- Public artifacts must remain independently verifiable and must not silently claim cryptographic guarantees the implementation does not provide.

## Validate changes

Run the checks relevant to edited code before handing work off:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo fmt --manifest-path runtime/Cargo.toml --check \
  -p notary-core -p notaryd -p notaryctl \
  -p notary-updater -p notary-server
cargo test -p notary-api -p notary-server-platform-adapter --all-targets --all-features
cargo test --manifest-path runtime/Cargo.toml --workspace --all-targets --all-features
npm --prefix runtime/apps/admin-dashboard run build
npm --prefix platform/web run build
npm --prefix runtime/apps/admin-dashboard run check:local-docs
node scripts/check-terminology.mjs
```

For Compose or deployment changes, also validate `docker compose config --quiet` with placeholder required variables. Do not put real keys, tunnel tokens, signing keys, captures, or `.env` files in Git.

## Stacked pull requests

Use `gh stack` for two or more dependent PRs; use a normal PR for an independent change. Keep stacks linear, ordered from foundational changes at the bottom to dependent changes at the top. Use separate stacks for parallel work.

Before the first stack, install the extension with `gh extension install github/gh-stack` if `gh stack` is unavailable, then configure non-interactive operation:

```bash
git config rerere.enabled true
git config remote.pushDefault origin
```

Use `codex/` branch names and standard `git add`/`git commit` so every layer is deliberate:

```bash
gh stack init codex/<bottom-branch>
gh stack add codex/<next-branch>
gh stack submit --auto          # creates draft PRs
gh stack submit --auto --open   # marks the stack ready for review
gh stack view --json
```

- All agent commands must be non-interactive: give `init`, `add`, and `checkout` a branch or PR argument; use `submit --auto`, `view --json`, and `merge --yes`.
- Put fixes on the layer where they belong. After changing a lower layer, run `gh stack rebase --upstack`, then `gh stack push`; use `gh stack sync` after trunk or remote stack changes.
- After approval and green checks, merge with `gh stack merge --yes --squash`, not `gh pr merge`. Then run `gh stack sync --prune`.
- On a rebase conflict, resolve and stage the files, then run `gh stack rebase --continue`; use `gh stack rebase --abort` if the stack cannot be resolved safely.

## Working conventions

- Keep ordinary tests deterministic and offline. Real-provider and large proof profiles are explicit opt-in checks.
- Preserve HTTP/1.1 and streaming behavior unless intentionally expanding the documented prototype scope.
- The Cloudflare tunnel targets the stable `web` gateway. Do not rename or routinely recreate that service; replaceable SPA/API containers belong behind it.
- Treat deployment-compatibility dual writes as temporary migration scaffolding. Before merging any change that introduces one, file a follow-up issue to remove it and link that issue from the migration, ADR, or pull request. The issue must name both data paths, the condition that makes removal safe, and the cleanup and validation required; do not leave an untracked second source of truth.
- Treat generated OpenAPI as the exact HTTP contract. Regenerate clients and update every affected guide when a route, status, field, or authentication rule changes.
- Use the settled product model: Notary (formally Notary by Exalto), a Trace as the evidence primitive, Captured and Notarized as its states, and notarization as an operation on a trace. `node scripts/check-terminology.mjs` enforces this repository-wide. When a retired name must stay — a negative test, an anti-regression rule, historical material — classify it in that script with the reason rather than weakening the rule.
- Keep `README.md` short; put task and reference depth under `docs/`, and keep public-site copy and `platform/web/public/llms.txt` aligned with the same trust boundaries.
- Keep every PR narrow: address one specific bug, feature, or issue. Split unrelated changes into separate PRs.
- Prefer the simplest solution that meets current requirements. Avoid speculative abstractions, infrastructure, and product features; push back when proposed code or product design adds complexity without clear, present value.
- Update README or docs when CLI behavior, capture artifacts, trust assumptions, or deployment steps change.

# Exalto documentation

Exalto has separate private product and public runtime documentation:

- This directory contains hosted-product and contributor references.
- [`runtime/docs`](../runtime/docs/README.md) contains public runtime guidance.
- The public site contains the shorter user journey and trust explanation.
- Running services expose generated OpenAPI contracts for exact HTTP schemas.

Use the generated contract when prose and an installed service disagree.

## Generated API references

The local daemon serves OpenAPI 3.1 at
`http://127.0.0.1:8788/openapi.json`. Its committed copy is
`runtime/apps/admin-dashboard/src/generated/openapi.json`.

The hosted API contract is committed at
`platform/web/src/platform-api/generated/openapi.json`. Regenerate both through the
npm scripts described in [Development and validation](development.md).

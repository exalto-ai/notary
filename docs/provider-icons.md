# Provider icon assets

The local dashboard uses presentation-only provider mappings. The mappings
read the existing provider field; they never infer a provider from a model
name, hostname, or namespaced OpenRouter model slug. Unknown and missing values
use the neutral Notary fallback mark while retaining the supplied provider text
when one is present.

All four provider assets are bundled into the built dashboard. They are
rendered as decorative, monochrome masks beside visible provider text so the
same files remain legible in light and dark themes. The dashboard does not load
brand assets from third-party hosts.

## Sources and usage terms

| Provider | Asset | Source and terms checked |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI | `runtime/apps/admin-dashboard/src/assets/providers/openai.svg` | Geometry from OpenAI's official [Blossom asset](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/3hUGLn3ypllZ0oa01qOYVq/28e8188e6f11b84c3e876569d492734f/Blossom_Light.svg) and used under the [OpenAI design guidelines and Marks usage terms](https://openai.com/brand/). The mark identifies an OpenAI-authenticated provider record, is secondary to Notary branding, and does not imply endorsement. |
| Anthropic | `runtime/apps/admin-dashboard/src/assets/providers/anthropic.svg` | Anthropic symbol from the official [Anthropic press kit](https://www.anthropic.com/press-kit). Anthropic does not publish a separate license in the kit; the mark is used only as a small adjacent identifier and remains an Anthropic trademark. |
| DeepSeek | `runtime/apps/admin-dashboard/src/assets/providers/deepseek.svg` | Official `ICON.svg` and [brand asset usage guidelines](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/awesome-deepseek-integration/tree/main/docs/_logo%20svg) from DeepSeek's integration repository, which is distributed under [CC0-1.0](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/awesome-deepseek-integration/blob/main/LICENSE). The guidelines permit accurate use by developers integrating DeepSeek APIs and prohibit false partnership claims. CC0 does not waive trademark rights. |
| OpenRouter | `runtime/apps/admin-dashboard/src/assets/providers/openrouter.svg` | Current glyph from OpenRouter's official [v2 brand asset](https://openrouter.ai/brand/v2/openrouter-glyph-light.svg), cross-checked against its [2026 brand refresh](https://openrouter.ai/blog/announcements/brand-refresh/) and official [documentation repository](https://github.com/OpenRouterTeam/docs/blob/main/assets/favicon-v2.svg). No standalone asset license is published; OpenRouter retains its rights under its [Terms of Service](https://openrouter.ai/terms). The glyph identifies only an OpenRouter-authenticated record, even when model metadata names an upstream vendor. |

Provider names, logos, and trademarks belong to their respective owners. The
assets are not part of Notary's own brand and must not be reused to imply a
provider partnership or endorsement.
